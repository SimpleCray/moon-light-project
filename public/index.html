            <h2>Moonlight note</h2>
            <p>
                It’s the beating of my heart.<br /><br />
                The way I lie awake, playing with shadows slowly climbing up my wall. The gentle moonlight slipping through my window and the sound of a lonely car somewhere far away, where I long to be too, I think. 
                It’s the way I thought my restless wandering was over, that I’d found whatever I thought I had found, or wanted, or needed, and I started to collect my belongings. Build a home. Safe behind the comfort of these four walls and a closed door.
                Because as much as I tried or pretended or imagined myself as a part of all the people out there,<br /><br />
                I was still the one locking the door every night.
                Turning off the phone and blowing out the candles so no one knew I was home.
                ’cause I was never really well around the expectations of my personality
                and I wanted to keep to myself.
                And because I haven’t been very impressed lately.<br /><br />
                By people,
                or places.
                Or the way someone said he loved me and then slowly changed his mind.”<br /><br />
